# Equal Experts coding exercise


The requirements specify how each total should be rounded but didn't explicitly specify if the rounded items should be added (accruing error) or if full precision should be calculated for the total.
Given that most people expect a total to visually equal the sum of all line items plus tax, I chose to accrue the rounding error and wrote a test for this.
